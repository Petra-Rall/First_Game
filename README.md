## 🏰 Platformer Game using Godot Engine

This was my **first attempt at making a game** using the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
The game has been exported to **HTML5**, so you can play it directly in your web browser.

### 🎮 Play the Game

Play it on PC here: [**Princess-Knight**](https://petra-rall.github.io/Princess-Kinight/)
