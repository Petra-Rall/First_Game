# Platformer Game using Godot Game Engine.
This was my first attempt at making a game with Godot. The game has been exported to HTML format to play on a web browser.

The game can be played on a pc via this link : [Princess-Knight](https://petra-rall.github.io/Princess-Kinight/). (The game has not been optimized for playing on smartphones)

The assets used in this game are not owned by me.
